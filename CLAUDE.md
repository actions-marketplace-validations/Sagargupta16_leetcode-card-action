## Project

Composite GitHub Action that renders a self-hosted animated LeetCode card (contest rating history chart with the peak marked, badge, rating, top percentage, contests, solved count, Easy/Medium/Hard bars) into the caller's repo as an SVG, `assets/leetcode.svg` by default.

Extracted from `render_leetcode` in `brand/Sagargupta16/scripts/render-svgs.py` so anyone can use it as `Sagargupta16/leetcode-card-action@v1`. Built locally 2026-09-25; not yet pushed or tagged.

## Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.13 (what `action.yml` installs), stdlib only; CI tests 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14
- **Framework**: GitHub Actions composite action (`action.yml`)
- **Database**: none
- **Package manager**: none at runtime; `uv`/`uvx` for local lint and tests
- **Deploy target**: consumed via `uses:` in other repos' workflows; releases are git tags

## Run

```
LEETCODE_USERNAME=sagargupta1610 LEETCODE_OUTPUT=examples/leetcode.svg python leetcode_card.py
```

That command also regenerates the README preview. Without `LEETCODE_OUTPUT` it writes `assets/leetcode.svg`, which is gitignored.

## Test

```
uvx ruff@0.16.6 check .
uv run --no-project --with pytest==9.1.1 pytest -v
```

`test_leetcode_card.py` never touches the network: tests that reach `fetch` monkeypatch it with canned GraphQL bytes shaped like the live responses. It covers the chart path math, peak detection and label placement, every card state, XML validity through `xml.dom.minidom`, escaping, response parsing, the step outputs and the fallback.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has three jobs on every push to `main` and every PR: `lint` (ruff, 3.13), `test` (pytest, 3.12/3.13/3.14) and `action`, the only job that loads `action.yml`. It runs the action from the checkout against the live profile `sagargupta1610`, parses the SVG and fails if any output is empty. Because `action` calls the real API, a LeetCode outage turns it red while lint and test stay green.

`ruff==0.16.6` and `pytest==9.1.1` are pinned inline in `ci.yml`: Renovate does not read `run:` text, and ruff 0.16.0 grew its default ruleset from 59 rules to 413. Bump them by hand. There is deliberately no `ruff.toml`, so the full default set applies (it flagged ISC004 and FURB122 on the first draft).

## Entry points

- `action.yml` -- the contract: inputs, outputs, Python 3.13 setup, inputs mapped to `LEETCODE_*` env vars
- `leetcode_card.py` -- the whole action: fetch, parse, render, write, `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`

## Key files

- `leetcode_card.py` -- `fetch` (allowlist), `parse_profile`, `chart_points`, `render_chart`, `render_headline`, `render_solved`, `render_card`, `main` (fallback)
- `examples/leetcode.svg` -- live data for sagargupta1610, rendered 2026-09-25; the README preview

## Gotchas

- Adding an input touches three places: `inputs` in `action.yml`, the step's `env` block, and the `os.environ` read in `main()`.
- Composite outputs need `value: ${{ steps.card.outputs.<name> }}` and the `id: card` on the step that writes `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Without the mapping every output silently resolves to an empty string (credly-badge-readme-action shipped exactly that bug).
- The default title lives in `action.yml` and in `DEFAULT_TITLE`; keep them identical. `{contests}` is swapped with `str.replace`, not `str.format`, so titles with other braces render as typed instead of crashing.
- SVG collapses runs of spaces: the brand renderer's `"  |  "` and the default title's `" | "` measure the same (254.53 px in Chrome, 2026-09-25).
- The chart card matches the brand renderer byte for byte apart from the aria-label, which now names the user (diffed against `brand/Sagargupta16/assets/svg/leetcode.svg` on 2026-09-25). The brand repo keeps its own copy of the renderer, so a design change in one does not reach the other.
- A chart needs two rated contests. With zero or one, the card drops the chart and shrinks from 270 to 188 px: headline on the left, solved panel at the same `x=600`.
- The `PEAK` label flips to the right of the point when it would run off the left edge (a user whose first contest was the peak). The brand card never hit this because its peak is the latest contest.
- LeetCode GraphQL shapes, measured live 2026-09-25: a missing user returns `matchedUser: null` with the error "That user does not exist."; a user with no contests returns `userContestRanking: null` and an empty history; a user without a badge returns `badge: null`.
- Every fetch failure (network, HTTP, bad JSON, missing user, changed shape) goes through `FETCH_ERRORS` into one fallback: keep the existing file and exit 0 with `::warning::`, or exit 1 with `::error::` when there is no file yet. Outputs are only written on success.
- Any non-empty `errors` in a response for an existing user also counts as a failure. GraphQL can answer with partial data, and a nulled `userContestRanking` would otherwise redraw a good card as "No contests yet". Measured 2026-09-25: real users with a badge, without one, with one contest and with none all came back with no `errors` key.
- The env vars are prefixed `LEETCODE_` because Windows already sets `USERNAME` to the OS user.
- The card is written without a trailing newline, like the brand renderer, and identical data gives identical bytes, so a quiet day leaves nothing to commit.

## Repo-specific rules

- Keep the script stdlib-only. `action.yml` has no install step, so a third-party import breaks every consumer.
- The SVG stays self-contained: no scripts, no external fonts or images, CSS and SMIL only. GitHub serves README images through `<img>`.
- `html.escape` every string that reaches the SVG (username, title, badge). The accent is regex-validated instead, because it lands in attributes raw.
- `fetch` refuses anything outside `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (https only); keep `# nosec B310` on the `urlopen` line.
- No en or em dashes anywhere, including SVG text and docs.

## Usage

- In a workflow: `uses: Sagargupta16/leetcode-card-action@v1` with `username`; the caller's workflow commits the SVG itself (README Quick start).
- Standalone: `LEETCODE_USERNAME=<u> python leetcode_card.py`.

## Config

- No config file. Everything flows action input -> env var -> script: `LEETCODE_USERNAME` (required), `LEETCODE_OUTPUT`, `LEETCODE_ACCENT`, `LEETCODE_TITLE`.
- Outputs written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`: `rating`, `badge`, `solved`, `contests`; `rating` and `badge` are empty when the user has none.

## Release

- Not yet done. Publishing is: push `main`, tag `v1.0.0`, point the moving `v1` tag at it, then list it on the Marketplace. The name "LeetCode Card" (slug `leetcode-card`) returned 404 on the Marketplace on 2026-09-25, so it was free that day.
